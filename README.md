> *Modified Recursive QAOA for Exact Max-Cut Solutions on Bipartite Graphs: Closing the Gap Beyond QAOA Limit*  
> [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13207](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13207)

The repository provides everything needed to reproduce the results presented in the paper, including:

1. **Source code** for all numerical simulations (Modified RQAOA and QAOA benchmarks)  
2. **Benchmark dataset** containing all 382 bipartite graph instances used in the experiments  
   - 182 unweighted graphs  
   - 200 weighted graphs  
3. **Simulation results** in machine-readable `.pkl` format  
4. **Plotting notebooks** used to generate all figures presented in the paper

This repository is intended to serve as a reference and benchmarking resource for researchers studying variational quantum algorithms and Max-Cut optimization on bipartite graphs.

- The main RQAOA implementation is provided in **`RQAOA.py`** and **`utils.py`**.  
- Benchmark results in the paper were generated using **`benchmark_script.py`**, which performs parallelized QAOA/RQAOA runs.  
- Inside the [notebooks](notebooks) directory,  
  - `RQAOA_Example.ipynb` illustrates a full workflow on a sample bipartite graph.  
  - The plotting notebooks reproduce the figures reported in the paper.  
- The [graphs](graphs) folder contains all **182 unweighted** and **200 weighted** bipartite graph instances (stored as NetworkX objects pickled via Python’s `pickle` module).  
- The [sim_results](sim_results) folder stores the corresponding **simulation results** generated by the benchmark script.

## Usage

### 1. Running Benchmarks
To reproduce the benchmark simulations:
```bash
python benchmark_script.py
```

Simulation results will be saved to `sim_results/` in `.pkl` format.

### 2. Running Weighted Graph Benchmarks
To run the same pipeline on weighted graphs, modify two lines inside `run_one()` in `benchmark_script.py`:
```python
filepath = f"{GRAPHS_DIR}/WG{num_vertices}_{p_idx}_{i}.gpickle"
save_filepath = f"{OUT_DIR}/WG{num_vertices}_{p_idx}_{i}.pkl"
```

(Only add an extra **‘W’** before `G{num_vertices}` in both filenames.)

### 3. Viewing Results
Use the plotting notebooks to visualize and compare the Approximation Ratios (AR):
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/Unweighted_Plots.ipynb
jupyter notebook notebooks/Weighted_Plots.ipynb
```
